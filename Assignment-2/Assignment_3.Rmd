In question 2, we found a #Value of 0.08745247, which is almost the same as the value of 0.1003643 in question 5. The exact method and the naÃ¯ve bayes technique are the same except that the former requires each independent variable to be precisely classified in order to make a prediction, while the latter does not. We can verify that the value derived from question 2 is more accurate. Taking into account that the exact values from the pivot table were utilized.


# 7.
```{r}
naviebayes.model <- naiveBayes(Personal.Loan ~ Online + CreditCard, data = df.Train)
to.predict = data.frame(Online=1, CreditCard= 1)
predict(naviebayes.model, to.predict,type = 'raw')
```

#We have the value 0.1003643 from task 5, and we have 0.9081939 from question 7. This is very much the same result that we got from assignment 5. ###Very little is changed as a result of rounding. The difference won't have an impact on the output's ranking order.
